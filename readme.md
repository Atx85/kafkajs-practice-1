Tutorial excercise based on : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTwXG8lC2GM

Description:
    A basic KafkaJs example that only demonstrates the basics of kafka set up with RedPanda (which is again only used just for learning purposes)
    
Notes:
 - this tutorial is a bit outdated and the ts command had to be modified in docker-compose
 - this 'version' is running on node 18
